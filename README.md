  <h1># Sushi-Website</h1>
  <p>Modern sushi website with custom animations, built using basic html and css.</p>
  I followed the tutorial by Javascript Matery and completed this project over the time of 3 hours and 18 mins. (Link below) 
  During this coding period, I did the following: 
  -Use CSS variables<br>
  -Imported CSS files into other CSS files<br>
  -Used flex and position properties in CSS<br>
  -Created smooth and subtle animations<br>
  -Used the BEM naming method<br>
  -Maintained a well-organized file and folder structure<br>
  -Embraced the principles of writing clean code<br>
