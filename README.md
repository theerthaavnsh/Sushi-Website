  <h2> 1. Installation </h2>
To use the sushi website locally, follow these steps:

1.Clone the repository or download the source code files.
2.Open the project directory.
3.Start a local development server or simply open the index.html file in a web browser.
  
  <h2>2. Usage</h2>
Once the sushi website is running, you can navigate through different sections of the website, view the sushi menu, and experience the custom animations triggered by scrolling.
  
  <h2>3. HTML Structure</h2>
<p>The HTML structure of the sushi website is organized into several sections, including a header, main content, and footer. Here is a brief overview of the key HTML elements used:

!DOCTYPE html: HTML5 doctype declaration.<br>
html: The root element.<br>
head: Contains metadata and external resource links.<br>
body: The main content area.<br>
header: Contains the website logo and navigation menu.<br>
section: Represents different sections of the website.<br>
div: Used to group and style content within sections.<br>
h1, h2, p: Heading and paragraph elements for text content.<br>
img: Displays images, such as sushi dishes.<br>
footer: Contains the website footer.<br><p>

  <h2>4. CSS Styling</h2>
<P>The CSS file (style.css) defines the visual appearance and layout of the sushi website. Key CSS concepts and features used in this project include:

-Selectors: Class and ID selectors to target specific HTML elements.<br>
-Box Model: Setting margins, padding, and borders for elements.<br>
-Flexbox: Creating flexible and responsive layouts.<br>
-Media Queries: Applying different styles based on screen sizes.<br>
-Custom Animations: Utilizing AOS library for scroll-triggered animations.<br>
-Google Fonts: Importing and applying custom fonts to the text.<br><P>
  
  <h2>5. JavaScript Functionality</h2>
The JavaScript file (script.js) provides additional functionality to the sushi website. The main functionality is achieved by initializing the AOS library to enable scroll-triggered animations. <br>
  Here's an overview of the JavaScript code:<br>
 -window.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", () => {...}): Ensures the JavaScript code runs after the HTML document has loaded.<br>
 AOS.init(): Initializes the AOS library, enabling scroll-triggered animations.<br>
-Configuration options can be customized to modify animation effects and durations.<br>
-Additional JavaScript code can be added to enhance website functionality, such as form validation, dynamic content updates, or interaction with server-side APIs.<br>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2> 
This documentation provided an overview of the sushi website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with custom animations using the AOS library. It covered the installation process, usage instructions, HTML structure, CSS styling, and JavaScript functionality. You can now explore and customize the sushi website based on your needs and preferences.
